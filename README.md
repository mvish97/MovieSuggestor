# Movie Genie
## iOS app that suggests movies based on the chosen genre and minimum rating.
## Also suggests similar shows based on what the user has watched
### Uses the Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) 

#### Future Updates: Add Core Data to keep track of the Movies/Shows the user has watched to improve recommendations and make the experience more personalized ####
