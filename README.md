# Movie Genie
## iOS app that suggests movies based on the chosen genre and minimum rating. Uses the Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) 

> Reason for this project:
> Sometimes at the end of the week, I want to watch a movie but have to spend time browsing IMDb to find what I want. So, I made this app to save me time!

## How the app works
